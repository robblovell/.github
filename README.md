* A README.md template
* A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md template
* A CONTRIBUTING.md template
* A set of issue templates in ISSUE_TEMPLATE that can be copied to your .github directory to give you more options to choose from.
* A standard ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md to copy to the .github directory in your project if you just want a simple default.
* A standard PULL_REQUEST.md to copy to the .github directory in your project if you just want a simple default.
